Live Nft Auction front-end
This repo contains the NFT auction front-end to be used in tandem with three other repos. Together, the repositories make up a virtual live auction for NFTs. A user of this project could utilize third party streaming software and stream to an RTMP server found: https://github.com/ForrestChew/rtmp-server. They could then connect the front-end to the smart contract found:https://github.com/ForrestChew/live-nft-auction. Lastly, when a user wanted to download the images from listed NFTs, they could do so with a script found: https://github.com/ForrestChew/download_live_auction_listing_images.

Note: The remaining contents of this readme will focus soley on this repositoy.
